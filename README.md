Add brackets and good semicolons to Python

## Installation

```

#### On Windows

```bat
pip install pybracket
```

### From GitHub

#### On Linux

```sh
sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/donno2048/pybracket
```

#### On Windows

```bat
pip install git+https://github.com/donno2048/pybracket
```

## Usage

See [example.py](https://github.com/donno2048/pybracket/blob/master/example.py) (no need for anything except just running `python3 example.py`)

Or if you don't want the `# coding: brackets` at the beginning you could just run `pybracket file.py` or `python3 -m pybracket file.py`

P.S version 1.0.0 is more reliable and won't allow using `# coding: brackets` without `pybracket file.py` or `python3 -m pybracket file.py`, you should use it.
